  3. The Mexican Wolf
Endangered species that the next generation may not find
Mexico is also fighting to save endangered species living on its territory. The Mexican wolf is a subspecies of the common gray wolf, and lives in the Sierra Madre Mountains and the vicinity of western Mexico, although some time ago it could be found in some southeastern states of the United States. Unfortunately, hunting, baiting and digging puppies out of underground burrows have destroyed the population of these wolves. To date, their number is only a few dozen. <br>

As of 2021[update], there are 186 wild Mexican wolves, and 350 in captive breeding programs, a large improvement over the 11 individuals that were released in Arizona in 1998. 2021 was the most successful year to date for the recovery program, resulting in the highest number of individuals, pups born, pups survived, and packs. <br>

Approximately 60% of total individuals were found in New Mexico and 40% in Arizona although historically on average both states have had similar amounts of wolves.
